 The solution is Calisthenics or bodyweight exercises examples are pull ups and push ups etcetra. <br>
because they are just plain better than Weight training and cardio because  Weight training can cause <br>
injurys and cardio or any type of exercise that gets your heart rate up and keeps it up for a prolonged period of time. <br>
does not do that much to train your muscles. <br>
 <br> <br> 
</p id="plan">
The plan
 <br> <br>
 Warm-up: <br>
 Jog in place or perform jumping jacks for 3-5 minutes to increase heart rate and warm up the muscles.<br>
 Followed by dynamic stretches like arm circles, leg swings, and trunk twists to loosen up the joints and prepare the body for exercise.<br><br>

Pull-ups:<br>
 Find a sturdy horizontal bar or a secure tree branch at a suitable height for the child to hang from.<br>
 Perform assisted pull-ups using a resistance band or have the child use a low platform for assistance.<br>
 Aim for 3 sets of 5-10 assisted pull-ups, gradually decreasing assistance as the child gets stronger over time.<br>
 Encourage proper form, emphasizing controlled movements and engaging the back and arm muscles.<br><br>

Push-ups:<br>
 Begin with traditional push-ups on the floor, ensuring proper hand placement (shoulder-width apart) and body alignment (plank position).<br>
 If regular push-ups are challenging, modify them by doing knee push-ups or incline push-ups using an elevated surface like a bench or staircase.<br>
 Aim for 3 sets of 8-12 push-ups, gradually increasing the number of repetitions as the child progresses.<br>
 Emphasize maintaining a straight line from head to toe, engaging the chest, arms, and core muscles.<br><br>

Full-body exercises:<br>
 Include other calisthenics exercises to target different muscle groups and provide a well-rounded workout.<br>
 Examples include squats, lunges, jumping jacks, planks, and mountain climbers.<br>
 Perform 2-3 sets of 10-15 repetitions for each exercise, adjusting the intensity and repetitions based on the child's fitness level.<br><br>

Cool-down: <br>
 End the workout with a cool-down period to gradually lower the heart rate and stretch the muscles.<br>
 Perform static stretches, holding each stretch for 20-30 seconds, focusing on the major muscle groups used during the workout.<br><br>

Remember, it's essential to prioritize safety during the workout. Ensure proper supervision, <br>
provide clear instructions on form and technique, and adapt the exercises to the child's age <br>
and fitness level. Also, encourage the child to listen to their body and take breaks as needed.<br><br>
